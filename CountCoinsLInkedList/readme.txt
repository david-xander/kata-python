USING A DIFFERENT APROACH TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM
And changing the ways thing. Now we take care of using the less coins
possible. So it will get GREEDY.

We also mind of maximum 1 dollar bill. No more than that.
After the design we go throuh the TDD, to keep working over
the automated tests.

The original problem = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =====

There are four types of common coins in US currency:
  o) quarters (25 cents)
  o) dimes (10 cents)
  o) nickels (5 cents)
  o) pennies (1 cent)

There are 6 ways to make change for 15 cents:
  o) A dime and a nickel;
  o) A dime and 5 pennies;
  o) 3 nickels;
  o) 2 nickels and 5 pennies;
  o) A nickel and 10 pennies;
  o) 15 pennies.

How many ways are there to make change for a dollar using these common coins? (1 dollar = 100 cents).
